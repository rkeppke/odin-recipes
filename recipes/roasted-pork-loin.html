        <h1>How to make a Roasted Pork Lion</h1>
        <p>
            If you're tired of dry and boring pork loin, then this is the recipe for you. <br>
            Not only is this Roasted Pork Loin heavily seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, <br>
            and pepper, but it's also basted every 30 minutes with an olive oil and white wine <br>
            pan sauce.
        </p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong> 3 minced cloves</li>
            <li><strong>Dried rosemary</strong> 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><strong>Black Pepper</strong> also to taste</li>
            <li><strong>Pork Loin roast</strong> 2 punds, boneless</li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong> 1/4 cup</li>
            <li><strong>White wine</strong> 1/2 cup</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Crush garlic with rosemary, salt and pepper in a mortar and pestle to make a paste. <br>
                Pierce meat with a sharp knife in several places and press garlic paste into the <br>
                openings. Rub pork loin with the remaining garlic mixture and olive oil. Set into <br>
                an oven-safe pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place pork loin into the preheated oven, turning and basting with pan liquids every <br>
                30 minutes. Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 90 minutes to 2 hours. <br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F <br>
                (63 degrees C). Remove roast to a platter and keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place pan onto the stove over medium-high heat and pour wine into it. Heat wine and <br>
                stir to loosen browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice pork loin and serve with pan juices.
            </li>
        </ol>
